Shadow mapping is a technique used in 3D graphics to calculate the shadows cast by an object on the scene. It works in two main stages:
1) Shadow map generation:
    The scene is rendered from the point of view of the light, but instead of calculating the colors, you store the distances of the objects from the light in a texture called a shadow map.
2) Using the shadow map:
    During the final rendering, for each point visible from the camera, the distance from the light (calculated from the visible point) is compared with the value in the shadow map. 
    If the point is further away than the value in the shadow map, it means it is in the shadow.

It works alongside rasterization to add shadows. 
It uses a pre-computed map to determine which points are illuminated or in shadow.
Shadows depend on the resolution of the shadow map and may appear "pixelated" or affected by artifacts without optimizations.
Less expensive than ray tracing, but more complex than basic rasterization.

"Shadows are created by testing whether a pixel is visible from the light source, by comparing the pixel to a z-buffer or depth image of the light sourceâ€™s view, stored in the form of a texture."
